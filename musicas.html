<p>Letra: I, I will be king<br>
    And you, you will be queen<br>
    Though nothing will drive them away<br>
    We can beat them, just for one day<br>
    We can be heroes, just for one day<br>
    And you, you can be mean<br>
    And I, I'll drink all the time<br>
    'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact<br>
    Yes we're lovers, and that is that<br>
    Though nothing will keep us together<br>
    We could steal time just for one day<br>
    We can be heroes for ever and ever<br>
    What d'you say?<br>
    I, I wish you could swim<br>
    Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim<br>
    Though nothing, nothing will keep us together<br>
    We can beat them, for ever and ever<br>
    Oh we can be Heroes, just for one day<br>
    I, I will be king<br>
    And you, you will be queen<br>
    Though nothing will drive them away<br>
    We can be Heroes, just for one day<br>
    We can be us, just for one day<br>
    I, I can remember (I remember)<br>
    Standing, by the wall (by the wall)<br>
    And the guns, shot above our heads (over our heads)<br>
    And we kissed, as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)<br>
    And the shame, was on the other side<br>
    Oh we can beat them, for ever and ever<br>
    Then we could be Heroes, just for one day<br>
    We can be Heroes<br>
    We can be Heroes<br>
    We can be Heroes<br>
    Just for one day<br>
    We can be Heroes<br>
    We're nothing, and nothing will help us<br>
    Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay<br>
    But we could be safer, just for one day<br>
    Oh-oh-oh-ohh, oh-oh-oh-ohh, just for one day<br>

<p>Letra: Workin' from seven to eleven every night<br>
    Really makes life a drag<br>
    I don't think that's right<br>
    I've really been the best, the best of fools<br>
    I did what I could, yeah<br>
    'Cause I love you, baby<br>
    How I love you, darling<br>
    How I love you, baby<br>
    My beloved little girl, little girl<br>
    But baby, since I've been loving you, yeah<br>
    I'm about to lose my, my worried mind, oh yeah<br>
    Everybody trying to tell me<br>
    That you didn't mean me no good<br>
    I've been trying, Lord, let me tell you<br>
    Let me tell you, I really did the best I could<br>
    I've been, I've been working from seven to eleven every night<br>
    I said, it kinda makes my life a drag, drag, drag, drag<br>
    Lord, yeah, that ain't right, now, now<br>
    Since I've been loving you<br>
    I'm about to lose my worried mind, yeah<br>
    Watch out<br>
    Said I've been crying, yeah<br>
    Oh, my tears they fell like rain<br>
    Don't you hear them, don't you hear them falling?<br>
    Don't you hear them, don't you hear them falling?<br>
    Do you remember, mama, when I knocked upon your door?<br>
    I said you had the nerve to tell me<br>
    You didn't want me no more, yeah<br>
    I open my front door, hear my back door slam<br>
    You know, I must have one of them new fangled<br>
    New fangled back door man<br>
    Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
    I've been working from seven, seven, seven to eleven every night<br>
    It kinda makes my life a drag, a drag, drag<br>
    Ah, yeah, it makes a drag<br>
    Baby, since I've been loving you<br>
    I'm about to lose<br>
    I'm about to lose, lose my worried mind<br>
    Just one more, just one more, oh yeah<br>
    Since I've been loving you, I'm gonna lose my worried mind<br></p>

<audio src="Audio/X2Download.com - Empire of the Clouds (128 kbps).mp3" controls></audio><br>
<p>To ride the storm, to an empire of the clouds<br>
To ride the storm, they climbed aboard their silver ghost<br>
    To ride the storm, to a kingdom that will come<br>
    To ride the storm, and damn the rest, oblivion<br>
    Royalty and dignitaries, brandy and cigars<br>
    Related giant of the skies, you hold them in your arms<br>
    The millionth chance they laughed, to take down his majesty's craft<br>
    To India they say, magic carpet float away, an October fateful day<br>
    Mist is in the trees, stone sweats with the dew<br>
    The morning sunrise, red before the blue<br>
    Hanging at the mast, waiting for command<br>
    His majesty's airship, the r101<br>
    She's the biggest vessel built by man, a giant of the skies<br>
    For all you unbelievers, the Titanic fits inside<br>
    Drum rolled tight, a canvas skin, silvered in the sun<br>
    Never tested with the fury, with a beating yet to come<br>
    The fury yet to come<br>
    In the gathering gloom, a storm rising in the west<br>
    The coxswain stared into the<br>
    We must go now, we must take our chance with fate<br>
    We must go now, for the politicians he can't be late<br>
    The airship crew awake for thirty hours at full stretch,<br>
    But the ship is in their backbone, every sinew, every inch<br>
    She never flew at full speed, a trial never done<br>
    A fragile outer cover, her Achilles would become<br>
    An Achilles yet to come<br><br>
    Sailors of the sky, a hardened breed<br>
    Loyal to the king, and an airship creed<br>
    The engines drum, the telegraph sounds<br>
    Release the cords that bind us to the ground<br>
    Said the coxswain, sir, she's heavy, she'll never make this flight<br>
    Said the captain, damn the cargo, we'll be on our way tonight<br>
    Groundsmen cheered in wonder, as she backed up from the mast<br>
    Baptizing with her water, from the ballast fore and aft<br>
    Now she slips into our past<br>
    Feeling the wind as it blows you<br>
    Feeling the beams as they pass you along<br>
    Watching the channel below you<br>
    Lower and lower, into the night<br>
    Lights are passing below you<br>
    Northern France, asleep in their beds<br>
    Storm is raging around you<br>
    A million to one, that's what he said<br>
    Reaper standing beside you<br>
    Wind inside cuts to the bone<br>
    Panicked to make a decision<br>
    Experienced men, asleep in their graves<br>
    The cover is ripped and she's flooding<br>
    Rain is flooding into the hold<br>
    Bleeding to death and she's falling<br>
    Lifting gas is draining away<br>
    We're down lads, came a cry, bow plunging from the sky<br>
    Three thousand horses silent as the ship began to die<br>
    The flares to guide her path ignited at the last<br>
    The empire of the clouds, just ashes in our past<br>
    Just ashes at the last<br>
    Here lie their dreams as they stand in the sun<br>
    On the ground where they built, and the engines they run<br>
    To the moon and the stars, now what have we done?<br>
    Oh the dreamers may die, but the dreams live on<br>
    Dreams live on<br>
    Dreams live on<br>
    Ooh<br>
    Now a shadow on a hill, the angel of the east<br>
    The empire of the clouds may rest in peace<br>
    And in a country churchyard, laid head to the mast<br>
    Eight and Forty souls who came to die in France<br></p>
